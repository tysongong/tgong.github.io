        <h2><strong>Name:</strong> Tyson Gong</h2>
        <h2><strong>Subject of website:</strong></h2>
        <p>Probably something similar to <a href="https://tribute.shop/">Tribute</a>, a sneaker/used clothing store (Might change)</p>
        <p>It will have separate sections for the types of clothing and shoes along with respective sections for gender or sizing.</p>
        <p>The plan for the look of the website is to make it clean, minimalistic, and easy on the eyes.</p>
